Create a two player racing game. When left is pressed, rotate to the left. When right is pressed, rotate right. When up is pressed move forward in whatever direction you are facing.

Slow a player down if they are touching the green grass.

Players must NOT be able to simply turn around and touch the finish line. You must do something to prevent this.

Make three new sprites: a finish line, text that says "Player 1 wins", and text that says "Player 2 wins". When a player touches the finish line, display EITHER "Player 1 wins" or "Player 2 wins" and then stop the game.
