2D Geometry Calculations

MUST USE INPUT VALIDATION

You can learn how to validate user input [here](https://www.101computing.net/number-only/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp) 
Complete the code to display the perimeter and area of your selected shapes.

Pick two: Right Triangle, Oblique Triangle, Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Trapezoid, Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octagon

1. Ask the user which shape they want to calculate (for example... 1 = Pentagon 2 = Hexagon)

2. Validate that the user typed 1 or 2

3. Ask the user to type in the measurement that you need (for example... Enter the base)

4. Validate the user input

5. Ask the user to type in the measurement that you need (for example... Enter the height)

6. Validate the user input

7. Say the calculation
