Turn in your finished text-based Python game based on Foobar.
[Copy/Paste the map class](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ohiofi/a1fc5080137a832ea42bc1fa7adc8318/raw/f647a82336357a3a4b09c1a2a834c56e61b3bb64/map.py) into a new file, map.py

You will be graded on the following requirements:

1. Have 10 rooms for each person in your group (group of 2 = 20 rooms, group of 3 = 30 rooms). Each of these rooms must have a unique description. NOT just "you're in a room". Have 2 or more items for each person in your group.
2. Have 1 special room for each person in your group. A special room could be: a battle with an enemy, a high-low number guessing game (to open a combination lock, for example), a fill-in-the-blank quiz game (to figure out a computer password, for example), or a locked door that is unlocked if the player has the key in their inventory/backpack and types "use key"
3. Must use the Map class to draw a map for your game (hide or show the items is up to you).
4. Print the room description, any item in the room, any items in the player's inventory/backpack, and the possible commands that the player can type.
5. Must be able to change locations and give a message like "You can't go there" when necessary.
6. Must be able to collect an item (using "take"), place the item in the player's inventory/backpack, and remove the item from the room.
7. Must have a break in your while loop so that game ends if the user types "quit", loses the game, or wins the game.
*** Put your finished game on Trinket.io with the map.py class. Turn in the URL for your finished game. ***
