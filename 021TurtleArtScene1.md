This project is to be completed with a partner.

Decide if you will be creating an underwater scene, country scene, or city scene

Requirements:

If underwater scene... | If country scene... | If city scene...
---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------
Water | Sky | Sky
Bubbles (random locations / sizes) | Sun or Moon (random location) | Sun or Moon(random location)
Seaweed (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes) | Clouds (random locations / sizes)
Fish (random locations / sizes) | Ground with hills | Ground with river or ocean
Starfish | 	Trees (random locations / sizes) | Skyscrapers (random locations / sizes)
Crab (or your choice) | Barn (or your choice) | Bridge (or your choice)

Additional Requirements:

Use random shades of colors on EVERYTHING. The blue water or sky will randomly be set to a shade of blue. Each seaweed and each tree should have a random shade of green.
Functions must be used properly and named with logical names (drawWater, makeSky, randomFish, etc)
Use comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment #draw fish tail)
Programmers' names must be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting)
