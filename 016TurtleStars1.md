Write code that will draw a star with 5 points, 7 points, 8 points, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 points. In other words... I should be able to ask the program to draw something crazy like a 15-pointed star or 16-pointed star.

Ask the user "HOW MANY POINTS: " 

Your code should use calculations (not x-y coordinates) to draw the shape.

You will need a for loop. Inside the for loop you will move forward(100) and turn right(___/___)

There are multiple solutions!

Bronze medal: you can only make stars 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
Silver medal: you can make stars 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20
Gold medal: can make stars 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20 using only 8 lines of code!!!!
NOTE: Notice that 6 points, 12 points, and 18 points are not required.
