You will be graded on the following requirements:

* Plan 5 "blocks" for each person in your group (group of 2 = 10 "blocks", group of 3 = 15 "blocks"). Each of these blocks/rooms must have a unique description. NOT just "you're in a room"
* Plan 2 items for each person in your group. An item is something that the player can pick up like a new weapon, a health pack, coins, a potion, some food, a fidget-spinner, etc.
* Create an array that stores the block descriptions AND a different array that stores items that you can pick up. In this version, the player does NOT need to be able to pick up the item.
* Must be able to change locations and give a message like "You can't go there" when necessary.
