Create one of the following collision functions:
- [areCirclesColliding](#areCirclesColliding)
- [doesCircleContain](#doesCircleContain)
- [doesRectContain](#doesRectContain)
- [isTouching](#isTouching)

## areCirclesColliding

Create a function that requires the following arguments: x1, y1, radius1, x2, y2, radius2. It returns True if the two circles are colliding/intersecting.

## doesCircleContain

Create a function that requires the following arguments: circleX, circleY, circleRadius, pointX, pointY. It returns True if the circle contains the point (pointX, pointY).

## doesRectContain

Create a function that requires the following arguments: rectX, rectY, rectWidth, rectHeight, pointX, pointY. It returns True if the rectangle contains the point (pointX, pointY).

## isTouching

Create a function that requires the following arguments: x1, y1, x2, y2, minimumDistance. It returns True if the distance between the two points is less than or equal to minimumDistance.
