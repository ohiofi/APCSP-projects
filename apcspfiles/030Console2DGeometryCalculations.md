2D Geometry Calculations

MUST USE INPUT VALIDATION

You can learn how to validate user input [here](https://www.101computing.net/number-only/) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp)
Complete the code to display the perimeter/circumference and area of your selected shapes.


**PICK TWO**: Circle, Ellipse, Equilateral Triangle, Right Triangle, Oblique Triangle, Pentagon, Hexagon, Heptagon, Octagon. (NOTE: You can NOT do Square/Rectangle, Trapezoid, or Parallelogram/Rhombus)

1. Ask the user which shape they want to calculate (for example... 1 = Pentagon 2 = Hexagon)

2. Validate that the user typed 1 or 2

3. Ask the user to type in the measurement that you need (for example... Enter the base)

4. Validate the user input

5. Ask the user to type in the measurement that you need (for example... Enter the height)

6. Validate the user input

7. Say the calculation

Sample Run with user input in bold
```python
Pick a shape 1=hexagon 2=pentagon: 1
You picked Hexagon
What is your side measurement: 5
Your area is 64.9519052838329
Your perimeter is 30
Pick a shape 1=hexagon 2=pentagon: lkjsd
Please type a number
Pick a shape 1=hexagon 2=pentagon: 2
You picked Pentagon
What is your side measurement: afsdg
Please type a number
What is your side measurement: 5
Your area is 43.01193501472417
