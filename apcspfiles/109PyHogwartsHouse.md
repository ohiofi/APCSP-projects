Create a Tkinter app that:
- says "Bravery Score (1-10)"
- has a box for user input
- says "Teamwork Score (1-10)"
- has a box for user input
- has a submit button

Create a function called hogwartsHouse that requires two arguments: bravery and teamwork. It returns a string.
- If bravery and teamwork are both above 5 then return "Gryffindor"
- If bravery is 5 or less and teamwork is above 5 then return "Hufflepuff"
- If bravery and teamwork are both 5 or less then return "Ravenclaw"
- If bravery is above 5 and teamwork is 5 or less then return "Slytherin"

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Slytherin</td>
    <td>High Bravery</td>
    <td>Gryffindor</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Low Teamwork</td>
    <td> </td>
    <td>High Teamwork</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ravenclaw</td>
    <td>Low Bravery</td>
    <td>Hufflepuff</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Create a function called submit. In this function, you must:
- collect the user input for bravery
- collect the user input for teamwork
- verify that both user inputs are numbers 1-10
- If not correct, display an error message *(do NOT use print() to display the error message)*
- call the hogwartsHouse function
