RandomIntArray

Concepts: arrays, random numbers, for loop, for each loop, modulus

- Create an array
- Using a for loop, randomly generate 20 positive integers and append them to the array
- Print a line that says "Full Array"
- Print the full contents of the array using a for loop

For the next section, you will choose to do either: Odd Integers or Even Integers.
Here is an example of what you would do for Odd Integers...
- Print a line that says "Odd Integers"
- Next, use a FOR EACH loop to iterate through the array and print only the odd integers. (Hint: you must use modular division)

For the final section, you will choose to do either: Multiples of 3, Multiples of 4, or Multiples of 5.
Here is an example of what you would do for Multiples of 3...
- Print a line that says "Multiples of 3"
- Next, use a FOR EACH loop to iterate through the array and print only the multiples of 3. (Hint: you must use modular division)
