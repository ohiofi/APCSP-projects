This is NOT a group project

Once you're finished with Turtle game v1.0... **DUPLICATE/COPY YOUR GAME**, rename it v2, and add the following features...

Create a player2 turtle that is controlled with WASD (or if you want, you can make WASD player 1 and arrow keys player 2). The two players can either be competing against each other or working cooperatively.

Create a turtle called writer. Hide it and put its pen up.

Create a function called writeScore(). In this function, have writer clear previous writing ( writer.clear() ), go to one corner, write the score for player 1, go to a different corner, write the score for player 2.

Create one or more enemies that will follow player 2. In other words... you'll have enemies that chase p1 and different enemies that chase p2.

Update your previous code so that if player 1 touches a coin player 1 gets a point, but if player 2 touches a coin player 2 gets a point. Make the same sort of update so that either player can die if touched by an enemy.

*** The first player to get 3 points wins. Have writer say "Player 1 wins" or "Player 2 wins" ***
