Here are the judge's notes for this innovation report: "The artifact provides an illustration of the purpose for Human Genome Sequencing. Even though computing is involved in order to 
complete Human Genome Sequencing, it is not considered a computing innovation. The response can earn [a point for] this row even though it isn't a computing innovation." 
Final score for this report was 1 out of 8.
