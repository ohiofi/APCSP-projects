This project is to be completed with your assigned group of 3 or more.

Decide if you will be creating a scene that is set in:

city
undersea
farm/country
space
Requirements:

Plan your scene with your group. Plan things that will be drawn in the scene (group of 3 will plan 6 things, group of 4 will plan 8 things). Assign jobs.
For THIS version you will only draw ONE of each thing in the scene. Only draw one star, one cloud, one fish, etc.
For THIS version don't worry about random colors or random locations.
Functions must be used properly and named with logical names (drawWater, makeSky, randomFish, etc)
Use comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment #draw fish's tail)
Programmers' first names must be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting)
