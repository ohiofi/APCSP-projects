In this small project, you will quickly research a computing innovation of your choice and present a “one-pager” about it. The computing innovation should be one that produces, uses, consumes or is “driven” by data in some way.

The One-Pager

In the professional world it is common to ask someone to do a bit of online research and then prepare a one-page summary or “one-pager” to show the rest of the team or colleagues about the highlights of what you found. For this project you will prepare a one-pager that explains how some technological innovation uses data.

General Process & Requirements

Review the One-Pager Template and the Rubric below.
Choose your innovation using the guide below to help.
Conduct your research by following the Research Guide below.
Complete the one-pager.
Choosing Your Innovation 

You should choose an innovation related to big data that you find personally relevant or interesting. For the purposes of this project, you may need to use a broad definition of an “innovation,” and it doesn’t necessarily mean that it has to be a new invention. In particular, we’re looking for an innovation that uses data.

Brainstorming

Start by simply going to [Google News (news.google.com)](https://news.google.com/?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) and entering the name of a thing you are interested in, followed by the word “data” or “big data.” For example: “soccer big data,” “shopping big data,” “music big data.” It might take some poking around, but you will find a few interesting things. Make sure you can easily find at least one or two reputable sources for your innovation and how it uses data. Other Ideas:
- Smart grids, smart buildings, smart homes
- The data behind your favorite app
- Online shopping trends/recommendations
- Crowdsourcing
- Crowd source inventions and funding (Kickstarter, Quirky, GoFundMe)
- reCAPTCHA
- GWAPs - Games With A Purpose
- Assistive technologies - aiding human vision, hearing, movement, etc.
- Machine learning
- Sports analytics
- Any kind of science data - physics, biology, chemistry, astronomy, etc.

Conducting Your Research

You already have some practice finding good resources online. You’ll want to find recently published documents from authoritative sources. There is no need to use overly technical documents, but keep an eye out for familiar terminology and topics.

Key Information to Find

- **Purpose**: the need, goal, or problem that led to the creation of the innovation. This is “what” the innovation was designed to do.
Function: how the innovation actually accomplishes its purpose. This typically means describing the way it consumes, produces, or transforms data. This is “how” the innovation actually works.
- **Effect on Society**: try to find a group that has benefited from the innovation. Describe the specific impact of the innovation on them in terms of society, economy, or culture. What is a negative effect that either IS happening or COULD happen as a result of this innovation working as intented? Do **NOT** bother saying:
  - hacking, privacy, security
  - it might be expensive
  - it might glitch or not work
- **Sources**: MUST include at least 3 news articles and the URLs for the news articles but you can use more.
