Create four functions that will __calculate and return__ the volume of shape 1, surface area of shape 1, volume of shape 2, and surface area of shape 2.

**PICK TWO**:
- Sphere
- Right Circular Cylinder
- Right Circular Cone
- Frustrum of a Cone (aka Conical Frustum)
- Square Pyramid
- Torus
- Regular Tetrahedron
(NOTE: You can NOT do Cube, Prism, or Cuboid/Rectangular Solid)

- Create a label for your first three-dimensional shape
  - Create labels for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 1" and when clicked runs the calculateOne function.
  - Define a calculateOne function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 1
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 1 and surface area of shape 1
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 1
- Create a label for your second three-dimensional shape
  - Create labels for any required variables (radius, height, side, slant, etc)
  - Create a button that says "Calculate 2" and when clicked runs the calculateTwo function.
  - Define a calculateTwo function that:
    - collects the variables for shape 2
    - calls the functions that return the volume of shape 2 and surface area of shape 2
    - display a messagebox that tells the user the volume and surface area of shape 2
