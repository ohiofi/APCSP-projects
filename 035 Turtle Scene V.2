This project is to be completed with your assigned group of 3 or more.

Python Turtle Scene v2.2 represents Sprint #2.

Hold a Sprint Planning Meeting with your group.

Plan things that will be random in the scene (a group of 3 people will plan 9 random things, group of 4 people will plan 12 random things). Some examples of random things are:

add a new randomYellow function that sets the pen color to a random shade of yellow
add a new randomNumberStars function that draws between 20 and 30 stars
add a new randomLocationStars function that moves to turtle to a random x between -400 and 400 and a random y between 0 and 400
change the old drawStar function so that it makes random sized stars
Assign jobs.

Requirements:

Functions must be used properly and named with logical names (randomBlue, drawSky, randomFish, etc)
Use comments to explain your steps (before a loop you might comment #draw fish's tail)
Programmers' first names must be displayed on the scene (like an artist's signature at the bottom of a painting)
