Move your sprite to the bottom of the stage, so that it looks like it's standing on the ground.
Create multiple scripts so that:
    When the right arrow is pressed, it faces right, moves forward, and it's legs move.
    When the left arrow is pressed, it faces left, moves forward, it's legs move, and it does NOT flip upside-down.
    When the space bar is pressed, it slowly jumps up and then slowly comes back down to the ground.
    Raise your hand when finished
