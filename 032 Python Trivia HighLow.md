Create a variable called score and set it to some large number (for example, 10 or 100).

Create three trivia questions in which the answers are numbers. You must validate the input or the program will crash. For example, how many times have the Cubs won the world series?

While the user's answer is wrong, tell them if their answer is "Too high" or "Too low", subtract 2 or 3 points from their score, tell them what their score is, and ask the question again. Repeat the question until they get it right.

When they answer correctly, say "Correct!", add 4 or 5 points to their score, tell them what their score is, and move on to the next question.
