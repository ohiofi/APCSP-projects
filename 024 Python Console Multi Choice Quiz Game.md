In this project you will use while loop, not, input, print, and a few other things.

Introduce the game by explaining, "This is a Multiple Choice Quiz Game with 3 Questions. You will answer each question by typing the correct letter: 1, 2, or 3."

Ask the first question. For example... "Who painted the Mona Lisa? 1) Pablo Picasso 2) Leonardo DaVinci 3) Vincent Van Gogh"

While the user input does not equal the correct answer, say "Try Again" and ask the first question again. It will repeat saying "Try Again" and asking the question FOREVER, unless the player answers correctly. When the answer is correct, the code will automatically leave the while loop.

Say "Correct"

You should know what to do for the remaining 2 questions. Rather than starting over and re-typing the code for each question... you might want to copy and paste the code for question 1 and just change some details.

Here is a Sample Run. User input is in bold
```python
This is a Multiple Choice Quiz Game with 3 Questions. You will answer each question by typing the correct letter: 1, 2, or 3.
What language is this coded in? a = Python b = Scratch c = Roblox script b
Try again.
What language is this coded in? a = Python b = Scratch c = Roblox script a
Correct!
Which of these isn't an online game? a = Roblox b = Minecraft c = Lego a
Try again.
Which of these isn't an online game? a = Roblox b = Minecraft c = Lego c
Correct!
Is this the last question? a = yes b = no c = Roblox a
Correct!
